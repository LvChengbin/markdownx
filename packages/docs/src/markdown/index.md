Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away. And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall there with a sigh. <br />
O troupe of little vagrants of the world, leave your footprints in my words. <br />
The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover. It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal. <br />
It is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom. <br />
The mighty desert is burning for the love of a blade of grass who shakes her head and laughs and flies away. <br />
If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars. <br />
The sands in your way beg for your song and your movement, dancing water. Will you carry the burden of their lameness?
